I'm Hakan, a versatile software developer with three years of experience
developing web applications and services, creating efficient data
pipelines and training/deploying machine learning models for different
purposes. I'm fluent in Python, SQL, and English. I've also written a
good amount of TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I have some
exposure to Go and Java.

My journey in the tech world began with a deep fascination for data science and its potential to uncover valuable insights from complex datasets. As a Data Scientist, I honed my skills in machine learning, data analysis, and data visualization, working on projects that involved solving real-world challenges with data-driven solutions. I had the chance to collaborate with some of the biggest gaming companies in Europe, which provided me with invaluable experiences and a deep understanding of the industry's inner workings.

After I decided to learn web development to be able to provide end-to-end, full-stack solutions to companies so that the insights can be easily shared with relevant stakeholders. I added various web development technologies to my skillset, including React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. Currently, I'm working as a Freelance Software Developer, helping companies build their online presence and create data-driven web applications.
